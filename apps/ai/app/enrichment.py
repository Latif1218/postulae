"""
Content Enrichment for Postulae CV Generator.

INCREMENTAL ENRICHMENT STRATEGY (Stability + Performance):
Instead of global rewriting, enrichment is now INCREMENTAL and CONTROLLED.

Core Rule: 1 enrichment unit = 1 bullet point added to an existing experience.

PFR Gap Estimation:
- Missing PFR = target (92) - current PFR
- Assume 1 bullet ≈ +2.5% PFR (empirical average)
- Derive number of bullets needed (rounded DOWN for safety)

Incremental Process (SINGLE PASS):
1. Calculate PFR gap
2. Estimate bullets needed (max 10 per pass for safety)
3. Add bullets to experiences with fewest bullets
4. Maximum: +1 bullet per experience (ceiling: 5 total per experience)
5. NO new experiences created
6. NO global rewriting

Hard Execution Limits:
- ONE enrichment pass only (no retry loops)
- Accept result even if PFR target not reached
- Maximum 10 bullets added per pass (safety cap)
- No retry if enrichment is insufficient

This ensures predictable, stable, and fast enrichment without unbounded loops.
